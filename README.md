# KM4MLS Raspberry Pi AX.25 Packet Radio Station

This is a collection of scripts and documentation written by Brian, KM4MLS
to aid in the set-up of a Raspberry Pi based AX.25 Packet Radio Node. 

The scripts are designed to take the headache out of setting up the software
needed to run a sound card TNC (Direwolf "Sound Card" Modem/TNC) and the 
node switch software (LINBPQ) required to run a NET/ROM packet node.

The most frustrating part of setting up and running this type of system is 
trying to figure out how to configure those two software packages. Indead,
there is a bit of a learning-curve when first attempting to use thesm, and
my aim here is to try to make it a bit easier to get started.

As of this writing, I am still in the process of refining the scripts, they
should be considered beta at best at the moment. Please let me know if you 
have any suggestions for improvements or if you run in to any problems when
running them. Check back soon for updates.

Thank you & 73,

KM4MLS
