# KM4MLS Raspberry Pi AX.25 Packet Radio Station

This is a collection of scripts and documentation written by Brian, KM4MLS
to aid in the set-up of a Raspberry Pi based AX.25 Packet Radio Node. 

The scripts are designed to take the headache out of setting up the software
needed to run a sound card TNC (Direwolf "Sound Card" Modem/TNC) and the 
node switch software (LINBPQ).

The most frustrating part of setting up and running this type of system is 
trying to figure out how to configure those two software packages. Indead,
there is a bit of a learning-curve when first attempting to use these software
packages, and  my aim here is to try to make it a bit easier to get started.

As of this writing, I am still in the process of coding the scripts, this is
a placeholder for the space to put them when complete.  Check back soon for 
updates.

Thank you & 73,

KM4MLS
